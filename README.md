# diff prez

In the midst of a transiton from one presidential regime to another, our team decided 
to create a simple tool to allow anybody to see how the White House's image has changed.

Specifically, we targeted their <strong>White House web pages</strong> for analysis. 

You may search for terms such as "LGBT" or "climate change" or "Russia", then see what
results pop up for the current (Trump - <a href = www.whitehouse.gov>whitehouse.gov</a>) and former (Obama - <a href= www.obamawhitehouse.gov>obamawhitehouse.gov</a>)
presidents' front pages.

Ultimately, we hope that this tool will enable people to not only see the differences between the 
two presidencies, but also to better acknowledge where they may find common ground.

<h2>Methodology:</h2>

<strong>HTML</strong> parsing tool known as <strong>JSoup</strong> - (<a href=https://github.com/SeanFlannery>Sean Flannery</a>)
- Built <strong>Server</strong> written using <strong>Node.js</strong> to access the <strong>MySQL</strong> database 
created to house the data from the crawler - (<a href=https://github.com/mashbeck>Matthew Ashbeck</a>)
- Crafted a gorgeous UI using <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>HTML</strong> - (<a href=https://github.com/jgrider>Jonathan Grider</a>)
